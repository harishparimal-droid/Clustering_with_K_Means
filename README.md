# Clustering_with_K_Means
This Python code performs K-Means clustering on the Mall_Customers dataset, using the elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters. It visualizes clusters based on income and spending score, evaluates them with silhouette score, and optionally uses PCA for multi-feature visualization and cluster analysis.
